gameplan:

	- got a list of all the functions whose interface needs to change
	- got a list of all the places those functions are referenced 
	- scoped individual funcs
	- scoped nmf_init_rand. probably fine to leave as is
	- scoped recons. potential problem

	- figure out and change everything except nmf_init_rand.  
	- look for "dead" spectinfo references
	- at a later date: figure out stft_si, istft_si, recons_si.
