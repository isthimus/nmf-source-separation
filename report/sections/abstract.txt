BUILDING AN NMF SOURCE SEPARATION TOOLBOX FOR MUSICAL AUDIO

Non Negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) has proven to be an effective tool in source separation problems for musical audio. This report presents a MATLAB framework for source separation using NMF. Several related algorithms have been implemented and benchmarked, and the software is highly modular and extensible. We also present a discussion and timeline of future work, including score-aware implementations and release as a MATLAB toolbox.
