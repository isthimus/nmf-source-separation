LR 1 "approaches to source sep"

can talk about when first studied
can give mixture model 
Beam forming (5 SENTENCE)
independent component analysis (5 SENTENCE)
NMF (what it does - rank reduction etc. ehy its cool) + lee + seung

LR2 "NMF"

interpretation of the matrices wrt audio + how to recover (phases not given! see LR4)
"sources" under NMF are really "notes". problems with how to unify by instrument.
update rules, distance measures. sum dat latex

LR3 "overcoming the drawbacks of nmf with SASS"

Why Nmf often fucks up in practice
SASS with a prealigned score. chroma, spectrum painting
SA:
	DTW - algorithm, feature spaces 

LR4 - "reconstruction and stft processing considerations"
Ensuring PR in straight stft. COLA, hop size, min freq representable. distinguish spectrogram (one way) from stft 
(theoretically reversible)
Reconstruction in actual source sep problems. phase issues - so paint phase? but phase addition issue. vib and phase pickup.
stft processing filters - why PR isnt enough for time -> freq -> time. pad vs convolve in small-gain vs binary filters. 

LR5 - "extensions to NMF"

SOMEWHERE IN W2D NEED TO TALK ABOUT EXTENSIBILITY TO NMF-SLIDEY etc etc
HTC
NMF slidey, apparently (x2)
CSMF

LR6 - "(existing toolboxes) and datasets"
TRiOS, PHENICX and underlying anechoic recordings
bosh around for existing NMF toolboxes, cite, make up some guff about how yours is different.

LR7 - benchmarks for source separation

SNR and why its a bit blunt, MSE 
SIR,SAR, etc - the theory
BSS_EVAL + permutation uncertainty
PEASS + perceptual benchmarking
