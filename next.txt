x quick look at onset and decision time on that.
x scope out empty bins also.

X hom for pen. 
X Copy up spectInfo insights + onset lookover. 
X CYTE for onset paper (with good tag) 
writeup redtext struct (top of head, can be .txt. standardised. read steph)

X figure out overlay display and/or click for comparison. 
X plan out alignment bench
X foldering - source/align, bench, might as well placehold user and kill remote as well
	X plan it out
	X once over of the codebase
	X just DDDOOOOOOOH ITTTTTT. YESTERDAY, YA SAID TUMARRROW. so just DHOOOOOOOOOO EIIIIIIIT

X see how aligned the ground truth is for TRIOS/PHENICX. consider MiREX/RWC.

alignment and onset benches, per Logbook 24-4-19 "onset and alignment benches roadmap"
	--- onset ---
	x energy first diff codeup
	x proto-bench
	x spec diff codeup - taxi
	x spec diff codeup - L2	
	x spec diff chroma codeup
	x median peak pick codeup (from diary)
	X energy first diff chroma
	shakedown spec diffs in order and assimilate with p-bench
	test and tune the peak-picker in isolation, then assimilate with p-bench
		include putting signals through separately and making sure they work in the matrix	
	onset folder in source/align/
	better bench with good plotting
	tuning (all audio files)
	some light writeup?

	--- alignment --- 
	midi prewarp
	midi distance
	dtw_multi
	align_dtw_onset codeup
		CHECK THAT CHROMA BIN 1 MATCHES BETWEEN FUNCTIONS
		I THINK ITS cb = mod(nn + 3, 12) + 1
		could write a function even
	align_dtw_onset shakedown
	align_dtw_freeEnds
	proper alignment bench	

	--- writeup ---
	proper figures for each
	"method" written up in detail
	redtext + cyte
		

=== next: source/user ===
if it's tomorrow morning now (25/4): new week plan, accounting for VHDL, writeup, code, toolboxing, citations....

spect from spectInfo, and clean up everywhere else its called. maybe a few standard spectinfos? less ad hoc
spect elision x 10 minutes
revisit nmf_init_func() and recons_func()
make new nmf functions + shakedown
MAKE RIGOROUSLY SURE YOUR NMF FUNCTIONS ARE COOPERATING XOXO

new SS funcs to include stft from spectinfo. revisit nmf_init_func() and recons_func(). spect elision?? might be v easy to impl if we just say "set by hand FU
AT THIS POINT IT IS A VERY GOOD IDEA TO MAKE RIGOROUSLY SURE YOUR NMF FUNCTIONS CONVERGE XOXO MKC
as part of this - change "align_" prefix to "aln_" or similar? small thing which actually makes a big difference on first look
