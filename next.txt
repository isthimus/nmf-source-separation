X align_dtw_onset running in plotter 
align_dtw_freeEnds ( or never? ) OR NEVER


proper alignment bench	

--- alignment bench magpie ---
BLOCK NORM AUDIO LIKE (nope)
different types of chromagram (nope)
weighting of onset vs chroma, "cautious" vs "agressive" onset detection
super pretty plots from benchmark_onset (currently sat in comments at the bottom) (maybe?)
SASS WILL DEFFFF NEED TIME TOILERANCE (haha maybe even nope)

=== alignment and onset writeup === 
proper figures for each
"method" written up in detail
redtext + cyte
	

=== next: source/user (this is basically bss or sass benching) ===
if it's tomorrow morning now (25/4)HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA: new week plan, accounting for VHDL, writeup, code, toolboxing, citations....
while you're here. align -> aln, nmf -> nss
	FUCK ME, ONSET VS ONSETS....
revisit nmf_init_func() and recons_func()
make new nmf functions + shakedown
MAKE RIGOROUSLY SURE YOUR NMF FUNCTIONS ARE COOPERATING XOXO
