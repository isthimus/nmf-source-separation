- midi POC
	- get W_mask looking right and find a way to verify W_mask/H_mask against piano_roll *** DONE YAS *** 
	- test nmf_init_zeroMask X
	- make audio_len_samp optional in makeMasks X
	- account for multiple tracks/ multiple instruments X
	- TOLERANCE X (for now...)
- code up a lil' hand-aligned source sep dealio (prolly don't test right now) X
- test HASS X (haha not done yet. will dive deep tomorrow)
- num_time_bins headaches X
- architect sep_sources_aligned X
- think about source/align folder struct X

2morrow =====================================
- HASS deep dive X 


=============================================

Alignment ===================================
- fix source/align/ folder struct X
- bash toogether stftInfo X
- bash together chroma from score with flag X 
- scope MiREX score alignment benchmarks X
- visual overlay verification - how?



==============================================



==== HASS, general framework code ============

- make sure youre passing "notes" around, not "midi" - mildy more efficient, much more flexible, and MATLAB does the pointer arithmetic :D
- stft_info struct!!
- proper tolerance functions
- code up sep_sources_aligned
- Reduce the amount of the spectrum we converge on for a big speedup
