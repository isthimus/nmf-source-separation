- midi POC
	- get W_mask looking right and find a way to verify W_mask/H_mask against piano_roll *** DONE YAS *** 
	- test nmf_init_zeroMask X
	- make audio_len_samp optional in makeMasks X
	- account for multiple tracks/ multiple instruments X
	- TOLERANCE X (for now...)
- code up a lil' hand-aligned source sep dealio (prolly don't test right now) X
- test HASS

- think about source/align folder struct
- code up sep_sources_aligned
- proper tolerance functions
- we should only converge up to nyquist, not all the way to fs. make that happen
