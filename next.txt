x quick look at onset and decision time on that.
x scope out empty bins also.

X hom for pen. 
X Copy up spectInfo insights + onset lookover. 
X CYTE for onset paper (with good tag) 
writeup redtext struct (top of head, can be .txt. standardised. read steph)

X figure out overlay display and/or click for comparison. 
X plan out alignment bench
X foldering - source/align, bench, might as well placehold user and kill remote as well
	X plan it out
	X once over of the codebase
	X just DDDOOOOOOOH ITTTTTT. YESTERDAY, YA SAID TUMARRROW. so just DHOOOOOOOOOO EIIIIIIIT

X see how aligned the ground truth is for TRIOS/PHENICX. consider MiREX/RWC.
alignment and onset benches, per Logbook 24-4-19 "onset and alignment benches roadmap"
	
=== next: source/user ===
if it's tomorrow morning now (25/4): new week plan, accounting for VHDL, writeup, code, toolboxing, citations....

new SS funcs to include stft from spectinfo. revisit nmf_init_func() and recons_func(). spect elision?? might be v easy to impl if we just say "set by hand FU
AT THIS POINT IT IS A VERY GOOD IDEA TO MAKE RIGOROUSLY SURE YOUR NMF FUNCTIONS CONVERGE XOXO MKC
as part of this - change "align_" prefix to "aln_" or similar? small thing which actually makes a big difference on first look
