=== getting bck in the swing ===
x quick look at onset and decision time on that.
x scope out empty bins also.

X hom for pen. 
X Copy up spectInfo insights + onset lookover. 
X CYTE for onset paper (with good tag) 
writeup redtext struct (top of head, can be .txt. standardised. read steph)

X figure out overlay display and/or click for comparison. 
X plan out alignment bench
X foldering - source/align, bench, might as well placehold user and kill remote as well
	X plan it out
	X once over of the codebase
	X just DDDOOOOOOOH ITTTTTT. YESTERDAY, YA SAID TUMARRROW. so just DHOOOOOOOOOO EIIIIIIIT

X see how aligned the ground truth is for TRIOS/PHENICX. consider MiREX/RWC.

=== onset ===
x energy first diff codeup
x proto-bench
x spec diff codeup - taxi
x spec diff codeup - L2	
x spec diff chroma codeup
x median peak pick codeup (from diary)
x energy first diff chroma
x onset folder in source/align/
X shakedown spec diffs in order and assimilate with p-bench
	X ooh fuck separate the plotters into spect and non spect
	X make sure theyre flying now
	X make it write to wav for much better comparison in SV
X block and row normalise

(test and tune the peak-picker in isolation, then assimilate with p-bench
	include putting signals through separately and making sure they match in the matrix)
	(no tho)

X add zero thresh for normalisation
X chroma bins hahahahahah

X better bench plan & tuning
	X figure out how to visualise the 12D ones
	X codeup 12D export (separate bench?)
		X wow the splitter does fuck all who knew	
	X conv
	X all audio types
	X see magpie benching list
	X also just write out all the functions you're calling and what their args are.
	X (good plotting) good charting

X write bench plan into LB
X write (but dont test) benchmark_onset()
X write (but dont test) leading edge()

=== onset tidying up and bench script === 

test:
	X benchmark_onset() 
	X leading_edge()
	X smoothing func 

X file-level bench design
X general bench structure going forward
X copy up to LB 

X move bench folder and realign paths (again lel). make sure things still work with bench not on path [WONTFIX]
	X while youre there, add "clear" to the start of every script that needs it

X codeup bench_onset, per LB 26-4-19 "bench_onset codeup"
X scriptlike bench for chart

=== GUD MRONING CEVILLIANS X 1 hr ===
assimilate results from onset bench (poss slip a few prints into main loop, le sigh)
pick up some illustrative figs(inc some rando 12D ones)
copy up results struct from "a tutorial..."
quick lil struct for the writeup, no bigs

=== alignment ===
spect from spectInfo
midi prewarp
midi distance
dtw_multi + figure out how to visualise
align_dtw_onset codeup
	CHECK THAT CHROMA BIN 1 MATCHES BETWEEN FUNCTIONS
	X make the nn2Chroma function work and use it (rename to nn2ChromaBin)
align_dtw_onset shakedown
align_dtw_freeEnds
proper alignment bench	

--- alignment bench magpie ---
different types of chromagram
weighting of onset vs chroma, "cautious" vs "agressive" onset detection
super pretty plots from benchmark_onset (currently sat in comments at the bottom) (maybe?)

=== alignment and onset writeup === 
proper figures for each
"method" written up in detail
redtext + cyte
	

=== next: source/user ===
if it's tomorrow morning now (25/4): new week plan, accounting for VHDL, writeup, code, toolboxing, citations....

spect from spectInfo, and clean up everywhere else its called. maybe a few standard spectinfos? less ad hoc
	onset_* in spectInfo even?
	while you're here. align -> aln, nmf -> nss
spect elision x 10 minutes
revisit nmf_init_func() and recons_func()
make new nmf functions + shakedown
MAKE RIGOROUSLY SURE YOUR NMF FUNCTIONS ARE COOPERATING XOXO
