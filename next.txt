=== getting bck in the swing ===
x quick look at onset and decision time on that.
x scope out empty bins also.

X hom for pen. 
X Copy up spectInfo insights + onset lookover. 
X CYTE for onset paper (with good tag) 
writeup redtext struct (top of head, can be .txt. standardised. read steph)

X figure out overlay display and/or click for comparison. 
X plan out alignment bench
X foldering - source/align, bench, might as well placehold user and kill remote as well
	X plan it out
	X once over of the codebase
	X just DDDOOOOOOOH ITTTTTT. YESTERDAY, YA SAID TUMARRROW. so just DHOOOOOOOOOO EIIIIIIIT

X see how aligned the ground truth is for TRIOS/PHENICX. consider MiREX/RWC.

=== onset ===
x energy first diff codeup
x proto-bench
x spec diff codeup - taxi
x spec diff codeup - L2	
x spec diff chroma codeup
x median peak pick codeup (from diary)
x energy first diff chroma
x onset folder in source/align/
X shakedown spec diffs in order and assimilate with p-bench
	X ooh fuck separate the plotters into spect and non spect
	X make sure theyre flying now
	X make it write to wav for much better comparison in SV
X block and row normalise

(test and tune the peak-picker in isolation, then assimilate with p-bench
	include putting signals through separately and making sure they match in the matrix)
	(no tho)

X add zero thresh for normalisation
X chroma bins hahahahahah

X better bench plan & tuning
	X figure out how to visualise the 12D ones
	X codeup 12D export (separate bench?)
		X wow the splitter does fuck all who knew	
	X conv
	X all audio types
	X see magpie benching list
	X also just write out all the functions you're calling and what their args are.
	X (good plotting) good charting

X write bench plan into LB
X write (but dont test) benchmark_onset()
X write (but dont test) leading edge()

=== onset tidying up and bench script === 

test:
	X benchmark_onset() 
	X leading_edge()
	X smoothing func 

X file-level bench design
X general bench structure going forward
X copy up to LB 

X move bench folder and realign paths (again lel). make sure things still work with bench not on path [WONTFIX]
	X while youre there, add "clear" to the start of every script that needs it

X codeup bench_onset, per LB 26-4-19 "bench_onset codeup"
X scriptlike bench for chart

=== GUD MRONING CEVILLIANS X 1 hr (HAHAHA 1 HR) ===
X fix up bench


X assimilate results from onset bench
x plotting codeup
x debugging

=== alignment ===
X spect from spectInfo
X midi prewarp
X midi distance
X scope out dtw_multi

dtw stuff:
	X dtw_buildCostMatrix_euclid
		X (ie build C then D)
	X align_dtw_onset codeup
	X align_getOnset_midi codeup
	X move files to where they should be

BEER? DENIED

X MAYBE TEST SOME SHIT IDFK
X CHECK THAT CHROMA BIN 1 MATCHES BETWEEN FUNCTIONS

X align_dtw_onset shakedown
X alignment plotter up and running

align_dtw_freeEnds
proper alignment bench	

--- alignment bench magpie ---
BLOCK NORM AUDIO LIKE
different types of chromagram
weighting of onset vs chroma, "cautious" vs "agressive" onset detection
super pretty plots from benchmark_onset (currently sat in comments at the bottom) (maybe?)
SASS WILL DEFFFF NEED TIME TOILERANCE

=== alignment and onset writeup === 
proper figures for each
"method" written up in detail
redtext + cyte
	

=== next: source/user (this is basically bss or sass benching) ===
if it's tomorrow morning now (25/4): new week plan, accounting for VHDL, writeup, code, toolboxing, citations....
while you're here. align -> aln, nmf -> nss
	FUCK ME, ONSET VS ONSETS....
revisit nmf_init_func() and recons_func()
make new nmf functions + shakedown
MAKE RIGOROUSLY SURE YOUR NMF FUNCTIONS ARE COOPERATING XOXO
