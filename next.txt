- figure out stft vs spectrogram ARGH :(
- test reconstruction in isolation with lots of prints and such
- finish source sep POC script
- rejig visualiser just a touch to accept partially applied functions (?)
- full harness
- make all nmf functions match nmf_euclidian_norm/ each other 
- run around fixing throw -> assert everywhere
- add a plot helper function to nmf_separate_sources bc then it will be clean af :3
