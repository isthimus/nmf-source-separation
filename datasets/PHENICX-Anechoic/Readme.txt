The PHENICX-Anechoic dataset is derived from the Aalto anechoic recordings of symphonic music, which contains four pieces of anechoic orchestral music. Due to the fact that the original recordings are made with the same gain settings, some of them have a lower signal-to-noise ratio. Here we provide the denoised versions of some recordings in the original dataset. The denoising procedure is described in [1]. Additionally, we have extended this dataset with score annotations, and we offer the configuration files to replicate our experiments for multi-channel source separation. 


For the intellectual rights and the distribution policy of the denoised audio recordings contact Aalto University, Jukka Pätynen and Tapio Lokki. For more information about this original dataset we refer to the web page and the associated publication [2]:
